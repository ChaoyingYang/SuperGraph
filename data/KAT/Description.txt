1. vibration sampling frequency: 64 kHz

2. Data files are in Matlab format. Each file contains samples and sample label:
data - the collected vibration sample
label - the label of the corresponding sample

3.Each file corresponds to the data under one working condition, and contains 300 samples, a total of 3 types of fault data, including health, inner ring fault, outer ring fault. 100 samples for each type.
