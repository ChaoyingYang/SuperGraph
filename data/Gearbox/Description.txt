1. LW-00, LW-01, LW-02, LW-03 correspond to crack 0mm, 5mm, 10mm, 15mm respectively.

2. The name of the Txt file is "input speed-load". For example, "100-0" means the data when the input speed is 100 rpm without load, 
and "100-2" means the data when the input speed is 100 rpm and the load is 2Nm. Each Txt file contains samples collected under six different loads,
including 0 load, 2load, 4 load, 6load, 8 load, and 10 load.
And each Txt file contains 9 columns of data, and the fifth column of data is used.

3. The nine rows of data from left to right are sensor 1 (on the base of the experiment table, the lower left corner of the figure below), 
sensor 2 (the bearing end of the driving wheel, the upper left of the figure below)ï¼Œ 
and sensor 3 (the bearing end of the passive wheel, the upper right of the figure below) ) X, Y, Z three directions, 
the focus is on the signal of sensor 2 .

4. Sampling frequency: 5000Hz
